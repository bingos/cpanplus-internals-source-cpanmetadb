NAME
    CPANPLUS::Internals::Source::CPANMetaDB - CPAN Meta DB source
    implementation

SYNOPSIS
      # In the CPANPLUS shell

      CPAN Terminal> s conf no_update 1
      CPAN Terminal> s conf source_engine CPANPLUS::Internals::Source::CPANMetaDB
      CPAN Terminal> s save

DESCRIPTION
    CPANPLUS::Internals::Source::CPANMetaDB is a CPANPLUS source
    implementation.

    It is deadly experimental.

    Usually CPANPLUS retrieves the CPAN index files, extracts them and
    builds an in-memory index of every module listed on CPAN. As you can
    imagine, this is quite memory intensive.

    This source implementation does things slightly different.

    Instead of building an in-memory index, it queries the
    <http://cpanmetadb.appspot.com/> website for module/distribution
    information as and when it is required by CPANPLUS.

    The default CPANMetaDB site is <http://cpanmetadb.appspot.com/>.

    You may set the "PERL5_CPANMETADB_URL" environment variable to an
    alternative if you wish.

CAVEATS
    There are some caveats.

    As shown in the "SYNOPSIS" you must set the CPANPLUS configuration
    variable "no_update" to a true value to use this source engine. This
    prevents CPANPLUS from attempting to update CPAN indexes.

    Attempting to searches and getting a list of out of date modules in
    CPANPLUS are incredibly slow due the million or so web accesses that are
    incurred.

    I have included two scripts in the "examples" directory of this
    distribution that may be of use. "installer.pl" does installation of
    modules and "updater.pl" will find out of date modules and prompt to
    update them.

    The CPAN Meta DB does not index authors. This means that this source
    engine has to cheat by populating the "author_tree" with
    CPANPLUS::Module::Author::Fake objects. The only thing guaranteed to be
    accurate is the CPAN ID of authors. Looking up a module in the
    "module_tree" will trigger a query to the CPAN Meta DB site, from which
    an author object will be created.

    You cannot currently query an author. Because of the implementation you
    will get back a CPANPLUS::Module::Author::Fake object, but the source
    engine just assumes what you pass in as CPAN ID is valid.

    If this is a problem have a look at CPANPLUS::Internals::Source::CPANIDX
    instead.
